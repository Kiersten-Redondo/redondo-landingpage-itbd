<h1>"SKILLS, HOBBIES & INTEREST"</h1><hr>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>
<blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <p>I believe everyone has unique skills and talents,
and that is what makes each one of us special<sup>[1]</sup>. People have skills in areas such
as playing an instrument, playing sports, being artistic, acting, singing, and many more. People
realize their talents at different stages in their lives<sup>[2]</sup>. Giving back to the
community by sharing the skill I have is what makes the difference. Everyone has at least one
thing they are really good at<sup>[3]</sup>. When each of us brings our individual talents
together, the world becomes a masterpiece painting<sup>[4]</sup>.</p>
<p></p>I am proud to say my special talent is playing <b>sports</b><sup>[5]</sup>. I'm
more of a like a <i>jack of all trades</i> person since I don't excel in a single sport but i can play
and do it properly<sup>[6]</sup>. I can play basketball,volleyball,badminton,etc<sup>[7]</sup>.
I can also run fast but not anymore since I'm getting older now<sup>[8]</sup>. I am fond of
computers, so I can say that I can use a computer properly when I was a kid<sup>[9]</sup>. I
get addicted to games, because of that I don't play tag with my neighbor
anymore<sup>[10]</sup>. I didn't have the chance to be an athlete because there are no girls
volleyball in a public high school<sup>[11]</sup>. I hope in my next life I can get the other life
that I wanted<sup>[12]</sup>.</p>
<p>I am a great communicator<sup>[13]</sup>. I can present my ideas well in-person, in
writing and through social media<sup>[14]</sup>. I’ve worked hard to sharpen those skills
because I feel that the value of a great idea is lost if I can’t present it in a way that others can
understand<sup>[15]</sup>.I am a real team player<sup>[16]</sup>. There is no room for a
“me first” attitude in the workplace and we all have to work together in order to meet
objectives<sup>[17]</sup>. Once I’ve completed my work, I’ll walk around my department and
ask my co-workers if there is anything I can do to help contribute<sup>[18]</sup>. </p>
<p>Another skill that helped me become a fast learner was being
self-motivated<sup>[19]</sup>. I have alwaysfound ways to self-motivate myself even if it is just
finishing school projects, cleaning my room,or even being physically active<sup>[20]</sup>.
Setting reachable goals for myself to complete helps me stayorganized so that I can stay
self-motivated<sup>[21]</sup>. Personally, if I am not organized I am not capable ofcompleting
what I would have to do throughout my day. If the physical things around me
aren't<sup>[22]</sup>.</p>
<p>Right now I am improving my skills as front end web developer because that is I want
to be in the future<sup>[23]</sup>. I hope that I can achieve the things that I want in the
future<sup>[24]</sup>. So that I help my family in terms of financial
issues<sup>[25]</sup>.</p>
<p>God has given us all a gift of unique skills and talents<sup>[26]</sup>. We can come
together and use our gifts to help our families, communities and the world<sup>[27]</sup>. We
can make a positive difference in the lives of others<sup>[28]</sup>.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<blockquote> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <p>In my downtime, I find happiness in simple
things<sup>[1]</sup>. Spending time with loved ones is my top priority.I also love visiting
museums<sup>[2]</sup>. Even though it takes a bit of effort to get there, I'm always excited to
explore new exhibits and admire beautiful art<sup>[3]</sup>.While I'm not always consistent, I
try to hit the gym now and then<sup>[4]</sup>. It feels good to stay active and take care of my
health, even if it's just for a little while<sup>[4]</sup>.And when I want to unwind, I turn to
anime. <strong>"One Piece"</strong> is my current favorite<sup>[5]</sup>.These hobbies may
seem simple, but they bring me immense happiness and help me appreciate the little things in
life<sup>[6]</sup>.</p>
<p>My next favourite hobby is watching TV<sup>[7]</sup>. Whenever I have free time, I
love watching Television. It never obstructs my studies<sup>[8]</sup>. Hobbies help us to
expand our knowledge, and it teaches us several things<sup>[9]</sup>. First, I like to finish all
my school homework and then start watching TV<sup>[10]</sup>. This lightens my mood and
sparks up the excitement inside me, as it increases my curiosity about the
world<sup>[11]]</sup>. Watching different useful stuff on TV enhances my knowledge horizons
and gives me lots of joy<sup>[12]</sup>. Watching TV escorts a lot of knowledge in numerous
subjects, thus it's a beneficial practice<sup>[13]</sup>. There are numerous TV networks that
cover international news<sup>[14]</sup>. I enjoy watching educational networks like Animal
Planet, Discovery Channel, and others, in addition to the news<sup>[15]</sup>. These
channels pique my interest and motivate me to discover more about various facets of
life<sup>[16]</sup>.</p>
<p>It's interesting that I watch a cartoon network since it gives me fresh and imaginative
ideas for cartoons and other artwork<sup>[17]</sup>. Tom and Jerry, Scooby-Doo, Mr. Bean,
and many more are among my favorite comics<sup>[18]</sup>. I get inspired to create them by
a lot of cartoons with art themes, such as SpongeBob and The Pink Panther<sup>[19]</sup>.
Mostly, comic book artwork draws me in and motivates me to use their characters to embellish
my scrapbooks<sup>[20]</sup>. Watching TV is not only about fun and joy; it also introduces
us to new characters and stories to analyse<sup>[21]</sup>. Every show comes with a new set
of characters and stories that tickles our brains<sup>[22]</sup>. As a hobby, you can compare
these different storylines and their characters with one another<sup>[23]</sup>. </p>

<h2>Interest</h2>

them is to become a <b><i>web developer</b></i><sup>[1]</sup>. I'm excited about the idea of
creating websites and apps that can help people and make their online experience
better<sup>[2]</sup>.Being a web developer feels like a meaningful job<sup>[3]</sup>. I want
to use my skills to solve problems and make things easier for people on the
internet<sup>[4]</sup>. Learning how to design user-friendly websites and make them run
smoothly is something I'm eager to do<sup>[5]</sup>.</p>
<p>As a student, I'm always learning new things<sup>[6]</sup>. I see my interest in web
development as part of that learning journey<sup>[7]</sup>. I'm looking forward to getting
better at programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript<sup>[8]</sup>. Each new
thing I learn brings me closer to my goal of being a good web developer<sup>[9]</sup>.I like
the idea of working with others as a web developer<sup>[10]</sup>. It's cool to think about
collaborating with classmates and teachers on projects<sup>[11]</sup>. I know that working
together can lead to better ideas and solutions<sup>[12]</sup>. What's really inspiring to me
about web development is all the different things you can do with it<sup>[13]</sup>. You can
make online stores, educational websites, or fun apps<sup>[14]</sup>. There's so much you
can create to help people and make the internet a better place<sup>[15]</sup>.</p>
<p> To become a web developer, I'm working hard in school and also learning on my
own<sup>[16]</sup>. I'm taking classes, watching tutorials online, and trying out new
things<sup>[17]</sup> I also like talking to people who know about web development to get
advice and tips<sup>[18]</sup>.In short, I'm excited about the idea of becoming a web

keep learning and growing<sup>[20]</sup>. I can't wait to see where this journey takes me and
how I can make a difference in the digital world<sup>[21]</sup>.</p>
