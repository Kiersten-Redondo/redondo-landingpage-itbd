<!--COLLEGE YEARS-->
<h2>COLLEGE YEARS</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting
<b>college</b> </b> marked a significant chapter in my life<sup>[1]</sup>.It felt like stepping into a world of exciting adventures andopportunities, where I could truly be myself and express who I was<sup>[2]</sup>. College, I quickly realized, was a place where <i> age</i> didn't matter much â€“ what truly counted was the shared desire to
learn, study, and graduate<sup>[3]</sup>. The absence of discriminationand bullying in this matured setting was a breath of fresh air. I observed that students in college were more understanding, having matured and grasped the concepts of right and wrong<sup>[4]</sup>.</p><p> However, the transition from my hometown in <b>Taguig</b> </b> to
the bustling city life of <b>Manila</b>,where I currently reside in a dorm, presented its own set of challenges<sup>[5]</sup>.
The higher living expenses in Manila, especially regarding food, proved to be an adjustment for me<sup>[6]</sup>. Navigating the life of college introduced me to the nature of
friendships<sup>[7]</sup>.</p> <p>While I cherish my friend group, I recognize that other students navigate college alone, a reality I have personally experienced<sup>[8]</sup>.For me, having true friends to lean on during tough times is essential<sup>[9]</sup>. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in <strong>Infortmation Technology</strong>.I find myself in the demanding yet rewarding world of my second year at the <strong>University of the East Manila</strong><sup>[10]</sup>. Despite
the challenges,I am determined to learn and excel, propelled by the desire to make my parents proud<sup>[11]</sup>.</p><p><i>Financial responsibility</i> is a crucial aspect, as I diligently save my allowance to alleviate the upcoming increase in tuition fees<sup>[12]</sup>. The course I ampursuing wasn't my first choice; my parents wanted Information Technology over my preferred <i>criminology</i> or <i>hospitality management</i><sup>[13]</sup>. While this initially posed a challenge, my perspective shifted over
time, fueled by the positive influence of a dedicated professor<sup>[14]</sup>. Now, I'm beginning to appreciate the subject matter<sup>[15]</sup>.
</p>

<p>My parents don't have jobs anymore since they retire, adding up the inflation that has happened because of the corruptgovernment<sup>[16]</sup>; I must fit in my allowance as much as possible in a span of a week<sup>[17]</sup>. I don't want to be more burden to my parents<sup>[18]</sup>. My father is now a trycycle driver and my mother
is now a stay at home wife<sup>[19]</sup>. My brother is studying in a <b>Taguig Science National HighSchool</b> so in that case there is no
tuition fee<sup>[20]</sup>. I am pursuing this course so I can help my parents in the future<sup>[21]</sup>. I want to spoil and take care of
them when they get old because they deserve it<sup>[22]</sup>. There is a saying that <b>"Habang may nagpapaaral sayo, magaral
ka"</b><sup>[23]</sup>.<p>Motivated by a desire to create lasting memories before entering adulthood, I treasure the freedom college offers<sup>[24]</sup>. I aim to savor every moment, recognizing the transient nature of this phase in my life<sup>[25]</sup>. As I navigate the complexities of college, I remain resolute in my
commitment to learning, personal growth, and the pursuit of my dreams<sup>[26]</sup>.</p>
